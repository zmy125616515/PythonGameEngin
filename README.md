## Introduction
It's the first project I create.For I have a dream for designing my own game long ago. 
That's maybe why I entered SUStect to study computer science and techology after working 5 years in a Pharm Company.
First I want to make a game in RPGMaker MV which is a famous engin for Janpanese RPG maker, but these too much comstrains 
in realize my imagination.So ,a more custom engin is needed for me.

### Frame
I create the engin in Python language with the package of `PyQt5` to show the game.
